# rTest
Testing tool for FME workspaces (ETL from Safe Software http://www.safe.com)

To test a FME Workspace you have to write a xml Scenario file compliant with the scenario/rtest.xsd application schema.
Then you can run it with scenarioPlayer.fmw. This will produce a html report file that shows the status of each process, a link to the log file, duration and memory consumption and the status of each checks.

See example in the  release.

Email to support@veremes.com if you need more information or a more complete scenario using a database based example (PostgreSql).
